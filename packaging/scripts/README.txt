!!! DO NOT USE THE SCRIPTS IN THIS FOLDER AS IS !!!

These scripts are my (Brother John's) build and package scripts for MinGW/Msys.
They are customized for my machines and probably will not run properly
elsewhere.

If you want to adapt them to your system and need some pointers about the
assumptions they make, contact me: brjohn@brother-john.net
But make sure you read and understand them first.

Note that these scripts are *not* GPL licenced like the rest of Photivo. In fact,
you may do with them whatever you like. No restrictions.
