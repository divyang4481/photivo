PHOTIVO IMAGE PROCESSOR

BUILD AND INSTALL
-----------------

Photivo has three build systems:
* QMake
* CMake
* Scons

CMake and Scons are experimental. They may or may not work for your individual 
setup but are generally functional.

The “official” standard way of building Photivo is via QMake. For a detailed
guide see the wiki:
